# JAX-RS, Rest Service in Java with Jersey

JAX-RS stands for JAVA API for RESTful Web Services. JAX-RS is a JAVA based programming language API and specification to provide support for created RESTful Webservices. JAX-RS makes heavy use of annotations available since Java SE 5 to simplify development of JAVA based web services creation and deployment. It also provides supports for creating clients for RESTful web services..

In this case, we are going to use build a RESTful Web Service in Java using Jersey. But, what is Jersey? According to Jersey website (https://jersey.java.net/): 

"Jersey framework is more than the JAX-RS Reference Implementation. Jersey provides it’s own API that extend the JAX-RS toolkit with additional features and utilities to further simplify RESTful service and client development. Jersey also exposes numerous extension SPIs so that developers may extend Jersey to best suit their needs.

Goals of Jersey project can be summarized in the following points:
Track the JAX-RS API and provide regular releases of production quality Reference Implementations that ships with GlassFish;
Provide APIs to extend Jersey & Build a community of users and developers; and finally
Make it easy to build RESTful Web services utilising Java and the Java Virtual Machine."


For this exercise we are going to use:
Java 1.7
Tomcat 7
Jersey
Eclipse IDE
